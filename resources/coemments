"I am a Computer Science Engineering student currently enrolled on a master’s degree on Data Science with more than 4 years of experience on the development of RPA Solutions and Process Automations in different automation tools being focused mostly on UiPath, Work Fusion (Java) and Python Automations on multiple systems.
In my previous position as an RPA Team Lead/Python Engineer I worked on the restructuring and refactor of the complete inventory of digital workers and infrastructure; it was a very complex task, but it was successfully completed and I’m glad to say that the team was able to recover and improve the clients trust. I also worked with an external client mostly developing and giving support and maintenance to multiple digital workers using open-source tools.
Due to these challenges, I was able to grow and improve a lot of my skills of both leadership and technical knowledge.
I love to take on new challenges that allow me to improve myself and that keeps me out of my comfort zone."
